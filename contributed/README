Thanks for doing this Perl program.  I have a web page at work that
contains maps of various networks, these all have a common file name
format six character identifier.  The page is a series of directorys by
state, city, etc.  I had been looking for a way to build an index of the
map files recursively.  Attached is your script as I have modified it. 
It is almost done but I thought it might be useful in it's current
state.  

The changes I made prune off the path from the file name, this is used
as a sort key for Graphics and PDF catagorys.  To make sorting easy, I
converted the format to a table so the sort key comes first.  I also had
to convert the file name accumulation to an array rather than the single
long string you were using.

The maps are all in PDF or GIF format and the final change will merge
those two catagorys in your program.  This is my first excursion into
Perl, thanks again for the code & long live Linux!
